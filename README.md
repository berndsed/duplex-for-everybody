# Duplex scan for everybody

Converts pdf files generated by a simplex batch scanner into scans that would have been generated by a much more expensive duplex scanner.

## How it works

First scan the front pages of the document into a pdf file.
Then scan the back pages of the document, appending the scanned pages to the same pdf file.
The pdf now contains pages 1, 3, ..., 4, 2.
Process the pdf with this application. The order of the pages will be 1, 2, 3, ...

## Deployment and usage

### As groovy script

Prerequisites:

* Groovy (at least version 2.5)

#### Build and deploy

1. Execute the gradle task 'asGroovyScript'.
2. Unzip the zip file in build/distributions into an installation folder of your choice.

```
./gradlew asGroovyScript
unzip -d your-installation-folder build/distributions/duplex-scan-for-everybody-groovy-script-*.zip
```

#### Usage

```
cd your-installation-folder
cat ~/your-simplex-scan | groovy simplex-2-duplex.groovy > your-duplex-scan.pdf 
```
